# Lands the CHANGELOG.md promotion (written by `release-calver.mjs --apply`) on
# main after the CalVer Release workflow has published the tag.
#
# main is protected (required `validate` check from GitHub Actions, strict,
# enforced for admins), so a direct bot push is rejected, and we do not relax
# protection for automation. The promotion goes through a short-lived PR:
#   1. commit CHANGELOG.md on release/changelog-<tag> (rebased onto main if
#      main moved; a conflict fails loudly instead of mis-filing notes);
#   2. push the branch and open the PR.
#
# GitHub does not start `pull_request` workflows for PRs opened with
# GITHUB_TOKEN, and `validate` checks from workflow_dispatch runs do not count
# toward required checks. So:
#   - With RELEASE_PR_TOKEN set (a long-lived token limited to this repo with
#     contents + pull requests write, e.g. a fine-grained PAT; GitHub App
#     installation tokens expire after an hour, so they can't be stored here),
#     the push and PR use that token, Validate runs as a normal pull_request
#     check, and this script squash-merges the PR (pinned with
#     --match-head-commit) as soon as GitHub reports it mergeable.
#   - Without it, the PR is opened with GITHUB_TOKEN and left open with a
#     warning: a maintainer closes and reopens it (which runs Validate) and
#     merges it.
#
# No loop: the merge subject `chore(release): CHANGELOG for <tag> (#N)` matches
# RELEASE_COMMIT_PATTERN, so the release run that follows a human merge finds
# no releasable commits; a merge by GITHUB_TOKEN starts no workflow at all.
#
# Env: TAG, RELEASE_SHA, REPO, GH_TOKEN (GITHUB_TOKEN), optional
# RELEASE_PR_TOKEN. Run from the release checkout with CHANGELOG.md modified
# and git user.name / user.email set.
